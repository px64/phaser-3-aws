//===============================
//
// MAGA vs. Woke Game
//
// Things to do list:
//    1. During 'politics', you can move barriers around, but not during 'insurrection'?
//    2. Alien Invasion: need to add a military Icon that you can drop helperTokens into to boost military strength
//        -- military strength can take on several different aspects.
//            - limited missiles to fire: more missiles
//            - faster missiles
//            - improved accuracy
//            - bigger explosions (would need to add missile detonation at destination and an explosion)
//            - more frequent reload (would need to add a time delay between missile launches)
//                  -- idea that also impacts putieville: perhaps each territory has a launch delay and
//                  -- it automatically round-robins between territories so the delay can catch up when returning to territory #1
//        -- How does user get to add to the military strength (or defense) aspects?
//            -- easiest: round robin: but doesn't make much sense
//            -- another scene that has slider bars for all of the aspects: the best but more work. Yes but need to wait for insurrectionists to finish.
//            -- a popup overlay when military health is boosted?
//    3. Need to come up with some negative impact of Putieville on the aliens attack screen.
//        -- See above on the round-robin reload idea for fewer bases to fire from
//        -- putieville can launch it's own 'decoy puties' that can impact or deflect your missiles but don't harm aliens
//            -- this might be pretty easy to implement
//    6. Need to add general rules for all gauges:
//        - If difference between Maga and Woke is large: health goes down
//        - If sum of Maga AND Woke is large: chance of icon collapse
//        - If difference is small: health goes up

// Problem: when we go to alien attack screen, we never encounter the insurrection screen!
//  you should always go to insurrectionist attack.  Actually go to the military allocation screen, then insurrectionists attack, then aliens attack

// Two player game:
// one player plays MAGA, the other plays Woke.
// During politics, each allocates capital to their own people only.
//  -- MAGA spends capital building better alien attacks and defenses.
//  -- Woke spends capital building better infrastructure against collapse/ insurrection

// NEW IDEA: have social justice only improve by answering difficult questions.
// It would be interesting if you get a mix of maga and woke characters that changes every game.
// or perhaps if you choose maga, the two defensive characters are woke, but if you choose woke,
// the two defensive characters are maga!



// Done:
//    add a 'quit' button to insurrection screen so it can end in case there are only a few threats floating around (maybe a timer?  30 secs?)
//          -- Have a Putie-ville (and China) that grow across the country
//
//            -- If difference between Maga and Woke is large: Need an indicator of this difference on the gauge!
//                 - fix gauge color so it stays the color of the greatest of maga or woke
